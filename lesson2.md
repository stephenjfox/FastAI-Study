I'm having a terrible time with Paperspace, disappointingly.
* Google Colab was kind of working, but barely (slow to use, different key bindings,
  start from scratch every time)
* Google Cloud has given me some struggles with sub-projects and I don't know how
  to resolve it.
	- Problem: Newly created project (that have less controls) can't make VMs that
	  use GPUs
		* Therefore, I can't use it for the course
* Paperspace has been giving me a world of trouble:
  - Buggy interface to my terminal
	- Non-responsive
	- Can't change my password on my instance?!

I know that I'm going to fast and loose, not pushing through to make anything
  happen.
* I want it to work
  + I'm willing to put in the work to make it work

I'm going to try Paperspace __one more time__, then I'm going to just make the
 instance on my _main account_ in GCP
- Not good security practices.
+ Going to get deliverable

May have found my solution...

* It's going in [lesson 1](./lesson1.md), where it belongs

[Wiki for lesson 2 recap](https://forums.fast.ai/t/wiki-lesson-2/9399)
+ Not a lot of homework
+ Includes links to the next lesson
- Not sure how it connects with the notebook labeled as [`lesson 2`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses/dl1)
  - Or why that's different from the [_courses_ project](https://github.com/fastai/courses/tree/master/deeplearning1/nbs)

Reading more *__carefully__*, the [Deep Learning for Coders Wiki Root](https://forums.fast.ai/t/part-1-faq/10330) clarifies that:
* The [courses repo](https://github.com/fastai/courses/tree/master/deeplearning1) has __older__ resources
  + Instead, you should be looking in the `courses` folder of the `fastai` project.
  * As I progress through the course, I'll have to vet the legitimacy of this claim
* PyTorch is what you should use to model research-driven experimentation
  + Don't hold back on the infrastructure technologies, if you have 'em
  + But _aim_ then _shoot_
    * Being a Research Scientist is different from a Research Engineer which is different from a Engineer
