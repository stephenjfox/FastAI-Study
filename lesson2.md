I'm having a terrible time with Paperspace, disappointingly.
* Google Colab was kind of working, but barely.
* Google Cloud has given me some struggles with sub-projects and I don't know how
  to resolve it.
	- Problem: Newly created project (that have less controls) can't make VMs that
	  use GPUs
		* Therefore, I can't use it for the course
* Paperspace has been giving me a world of trouble:
  - Buggy
	- Non-responsive
	- Can't change my password on my instance?!

I know that I'm going to fast and loose, not pushing through to make anything
  happen.
* I want it to work
  + I'm willing to put in the work to make it work

I'm going to try Paperspace __one more time__, then I'm going to just make the
 instance on my _main account_ in GCP

May have found my solution...

* It's going in [lesson 1](./lesson1.md), where it belongs
